This is simple Commision calculator app.

This is calculator web-page. Basicly the commision is 0.026% of a random deal in range of 10% - 50% of your balance.
When you enter Balance dollars it generates an random deal, then it calculates your chances of each reward size of that deal.
Daily you have 50 deals approval, so it also calculates the roughly total daily reward.

I'm using Vannila JS for my very first basic Azure static web app project.
